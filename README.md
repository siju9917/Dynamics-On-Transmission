## Abstract:

This study investigates the optimal approach to appending asynchronous (solar and wind) generators on a power system network using mathematics in network theory. Specifically, we consider an example network randomly generated from Chinese power system data as our experimental network to test our results. Before our significant findings the paper explores the fundamentals of power grid setup, necessary assumptions for modelling, and some mathematical formulation where we define our unique stability metric. Using our Chinese inspired experimental network, we were able to show a specific relationship between stability and connecting a asynchronous generator to the network. Other papers typically discuss appending a very general generation node, which ends up being equivalent to a synchronous generator and incorrectly modifies their optimal solution for appending renewable nodes. Our superior result incorporates the unpredictability of solar and wind resources when adding asynchronous generation to a national grid.
